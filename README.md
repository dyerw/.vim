What do we do when we get stuck on a nefarious bug or don't feel like 
doing real work?

We meticulously edit our vimrc!

Coming soon will be a table of all custom shortcuts! What would vim be 
if we didn't have to memorize numerous custom keybindings thus making us completely
  uselesss as soon as we pair on someone elses machine?

The goal of this vim config is to be attractive, modern, and easily extendable.

SpaceVim is all well and good but is basically its own client. 
For better or worse the bloodline is pure in this repo, I'd just fork it if you're interested.
I've jacked some of the better plugins from there and stripped out all the unholy emacs influence.
